## Project Background
AusRegistry Group was constructing infrastructure for expanding their management from the .au ccTLD to other DNS 2.0 ccTLD’s where the traditional .com .net’s were expanded into offerings such as .australia or .next

## Business Transformation
- Significant savings in licence fees, code compilation time & code quality were achieved through awareness and integration of powerful, proven open source tools that outperformed the existing commercially licensed alternatives.
- Systematic approach was implemented to transition the development team from the belief that CI tools such as Jenkins were blockers highlighting challenges in code quality to enables for rapid builds and deployment work-flows.

## NextGen Delivery
- Geb, Spock, Groovy & Gradle powered testing framework abstracting away the mundane deliverables of automation testing and allowing direct focus into test approaches and critical path delivery.
- Framework was of such quality that for 5 years after implementation it was continually used and expanded on.
