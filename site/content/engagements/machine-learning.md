## Project Information
Our client(s) wanted to expand the user personalization approach to websites to accelerate conversions and increase return on their marketing campaigns. There were already a world of tools available for interacting, understanding and optimizing conversion flows for known or logged in users, but its a green-field environment for anonymous users ‘if’ its possible to identify, track and categorize their interactions into a demographic & segment rapidly.

## Business Transformation
Prior to our involvement the primary method of interacting with ‘anonymous’ users was to subscribe to a large multi-geographical service (such as Facebook or Google) that the ‘anonymous’ user would already be logged into that’s prepared to share non PII (Personally Identifiable Information) with the company.
Cost prohibitive services that often required strong data-mining and provided the strongest benefit for known demographics of users when producing new content.
We revolutionized the interaction and discovery process for Anonymous users such that at any moment in time marketing managers could know exactly which channel for which demographic they should be spending to attract or increase conversions.

## NextGen Delivery
- Anonymous User De-Duplication: We could accurately identify anonymous users (across multiple devices) within minimal website / web-page interactions
- Multi-channel Attribution: All inbound channels for current marketing campaigns were able to be weighed, estimated and analysed where high degrees of confidence in each unique users next step were determined. i.e. Click link from Facebook -> Click link from LinkedIn -> Fill in form
- Content quality Scoring: each content piece created, image, text, video was able to be analysed and rated for the demographic it was targeting, immediately showing the changes in the Multi-Channel Attribution model.
- Demographic & Segment Drill-down: Each landing page on the website could be drilled down to identify the most profitable segments and funding decisions taken appropriately.
- Content Lifetime: Each content item as a result of Content Quality Scoring was able to be understood in terms of marketing life-span before the content became stale in relation to the current campaign.

## Additional Work
- Social User Segmentation: Logged-in users could be categorized rapidly (within 3 ‘likes) to a demographic segment
- Image / Asset Tracking: A major challenge the marketing industry faces is when their content is released ‘into’ the wild they have no way of understanding where its gone, we utilised Machine Learning tracking algorithms to recognise assets and their distribution over time.
