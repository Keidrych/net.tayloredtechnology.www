## Project Information
For a business to be successful online, they need to split their time and effort across many specialized tools to not only drive traffic to their website but coordinate marketing, optimize conversion and ensure suitable uptime of services. We created an integrated operational platform that centralized all the critical success services for SME’s into one dashboard through a WordPress centric approach.

## Business Transformation
- Upwards of 50% time & effort reductions for SME’s to acquire and convert customers into sales
- Internet ‘overwhelm’ drastically reduced with integrated in-store POS, inventory & drop-shipping management.
- Rapid customer sign-up and loyalty rewards for purchases online or offline on phone, computer or TV
