## Project Information
WordPress hosting can be an incredibly painful ecosystem, core WordPress wouldnâ€™t satisfy business needs, and some clients required over 160+ plugins to be installed to suit business needs with updates needing to be rolled out daily, and the potential of breaking changes being introduced with each update clients, vigorous backups, staging environments and roll-backs were essential.

## Business Transformation
Every WordPress hosting provide was evaluated, ranked and tested against our most complex clients with varying results ultimately highlighting the flaws of traditional hosting where larger servers were allocated to handle increased traffic. We fundamentally shifted the approach from larger servers to containerized distributed workloads working in tandem to deliver the clients WordPress content.

## NextGen Delivery
- We totally converted WordPress into a 12 Factor compliant application
- Removed all dependencies on MySQL as a Database, using a more Linux per-formant alternative while easily providing the ability for existing WordPress users to Port in and out of our technology
- Implemented a vigorous snapshot and zero downtime automated deployment process such that client sites would get infrastructure and plugin updates as soon as they were proven to be non-breaking with zero downtime
- Stripped out everything that slowed down WordPress enabling us to typically achieve 20-50x more performance than any other WordPress hosting infrastructure for page render time for both logged in and anonymous users
- Platform was able to scale to 2.5Billion Hits per month per site
