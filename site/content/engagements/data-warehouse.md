## Project Background
This $16 Million project was tasked with creating a Big Data system to centralize fragmented customer data from multiple legacy and specialized systems such as claims, quotes, external brokers, & billing to name a few.

## Business Transformation
- Original state was a still running 1970 DB2 mainframe with pieces of data scattered across many customer systems. CGU had budgeted $16 Million to centralize all data into a new DB2 Infomatica database cluster.
- Everything was moved & tested manually with multiple consultancies and contracting organizations responsible for each system piece.
- We coordinated between ‘Data Governance’, ‘Infrastructure (C&E)’, ‘Database Administration’, ‘Enterprise Architecture’ and others to champion, promote & direct implementation of a suitable automated system to ensure migrated data was valid, integral and all Personally Identifiable Information (PII) was secured & updated.
- Enabled the project to scale down numbers of external consultants, and ensure a strong knowledge transfer strategy was in place for transition of consolidated data to relevant Business As Usual (BAU) department.
- In conjunction with C&E team we initiated a company wide revolution in CGU’s awareness of Splunk’s capabilities from perception of Log Analysis tool into a full Business Intelligence platform.

## NextGen Delivery
- As a Data Warehouse centric delivery we primarily delivered an automation approach for ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) of data from all external systems into the new platform (built on IBM’s DB2) using an Automation First approach, validating data integrity for each step of the process.
- Successfully co-ordinated the implementation of the delivery with two external consultancies standardizing and educating on automation first directives.
- Championed ‘Informatica’s Data Validation Option’ from introduction through to purchase
